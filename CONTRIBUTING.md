## Contributing guidelines

 - create new branches from the **dev** branch
 - name branches after your feature (e.g. my-nice-feature)
 - work on your branch until you're confident the feature is complete
 - create a pull request that can be reviewed, then merge into **dev**
 - in the future we can run tests on dev, and when the build is passing we can merge into master

*to be determined...*
